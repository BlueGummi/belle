## Quickstart


If the build script **has not been executed yet**, run this.

```
cargo build --release
```

To **run a binary**, execute this.

```
cargo run --release -- input_binary
```

Or, **if the emulator has been installed**, run 
```
belle <binary>
```
from any directory.

Different flags can be passed to make the emulator operate differently.


| Field          | CLI                 | Variable type | Default value | Example    |
| :------------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :-----------: | :--------- |
| Input Binary   | `file`              | String        | `""`          | `main`     |
| Quiet output   | `-q` or `--quiet`   | Boolean       | `false`       | `-q`       |
| Verbose output | `-v` or `--verbose` | Boolean       | `false`       | `-v`       |
| Run debugger   | `-d` or `--debug`   | Boolean       | `false`       | `-d`       |
| Time delay     | `-t` or `--time-delay`    | Integer       | `0`       | `-t`       |
| Display help   | `-h` or `--help`    | Boolean       | `false`       | `-h`       |

# Usage

The repository that this emulator is a part of contains example programs. It's recommended to read the [assembler documentation](basm) before continuing with the CPU emulator.

To try out an example program, change the working directory to the `./examples` directory.

Then, assemble an example program. 

e.g.

```
basm -o fib fib.asm
```

Now that there is a binary, the program can be executed by invoking the emulator with 

```
belle fib
```

The runtime performance of the emulator is typically comparable to native Rust code runtime speeds, with a 10-20% overhead.
