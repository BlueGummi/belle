# Introduction

## Overview

The **BELLE-ISA**, also colloquially known as **"ISABELLE"**, is the instruction set for **BELLE**. This document and all further documententation will be referring to the instruction set as the **BELLE-ISA** to avoid confusion.

## Bit-sizes

The instructions are all fixed to **16-bits** in length, being able to change CPU flags, memory, registers, and other components of the emulator with the use of **pseudo-instructions**.

The opcodes are all fixed to **4 bits**, which reside in the **first 4** bits of any given instruction. Instructions can take anywhere between **0 to 2** arguments, and are formatted `Instruction Destination, Source` for 2 argument instructions, `Instruction Location` for 1 argument instructions, and simply `Instruction` for instructions that **do not take any arguments**.

## Instruction count

There are **16** total instructions in the **BELLE-ISA**, however, each instruction **can take arguments of different types**. For example, the `mov` instruction can take a **literal value**, **pointer**, **memory address**, or **register** for the right-hand side of the instruction, and the conditional `jump` instructions can all take either a memory address or a register pointer.

To accomplish this, *determinant* bits are used, which allow the CPU to *determine* what the next value is to be interpreted as.

## Directives and clock cycles

Instructions in this ISA all take one clock cycle to execute, with the exception of "pseudo-instruction" CPU *directives*. "Pseudo-instructions", such as `.start` and `.ssp` are read once when the instructions are loaded into memory, and the appropriate parts of the CPU are adjusted.

For example, the `.start` directive controls the starting memory address of the program, and thus when it is read by the CPU, the program will begin at a different memory address.

## Loading into memory

Instructions are all loaded into memory prior to the CPU being run, and the fixed-length nature of instructions in this ISA can allow for easy, efficient, and parallel loading of instructions.

# Opcodes

The following table contains each operation and its respective *opcode*, in binary format.
