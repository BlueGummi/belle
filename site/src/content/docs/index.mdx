## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/BlueGummi/belle && cd belle
```

Cargo, RustC, GCC, and Makefile **compatibility must be present on the system** if these programs are to be installed.

Every executable in this repository can have the `--help` flag passed to display helpful information.

```
./build.sh -w && ./install.sh -c # This installs the binaries to ~/.local/bin on Unix OS's
```

Or, for Windows

```pwsh
.\build.ps1 -w && .\install.ps1 -c # This installs the binaries to ~/.local/bin on Windows
```

The binaries can be run by calling `basm`, `belle`, or `bdump`.

#### Inspiration

[The Little Computer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) - Inspired some of the design aspects of the BELLE-ISA and BELLE, particularly word-addressed memory and the 16-bit nature of the machine (it's why "BELLE" has two L's - it's to honor the LC3)

[Intel x86 assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) - Inspired the syntax for the assembly.
