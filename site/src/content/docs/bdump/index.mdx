title: The BELLE disassembler - bdump

## Quickstart

If the build and install scripts have not been run, run `make` in the `bdump/` directory to build the disassembler. Then, the diassembler can be executed by calling it with `./bdump`, or can be moved to the PATH of the machine so it can be executed without the need to directly call the binary located in the source code directory.

Different flags can be passed to make the disassembler **emit different output**, but none will affect how it assembles code.

| Field                  | CLI                 | Variable type | Default value | Example |
| :--------------------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :-----------: | :------ |
| Binary                 | `file`              | String        |     `""`      | `main`  |
| Output original binary | `-b` or `--binary`  | Boolean       |    `false`    | `-b`    |
| Verbose output         | `-v` or `--verbose` | Boolean       |    `false`    | `-v`    |
| Debug output           | `-d` or `--debug`   | Boolean       |    `false`    | `-d`    |
| Display colors         | `-c` or `--colors`  | Boolean       |    `false`    | `-c`    |
| Display help           | `-h` or `--help`    | Boolean       |    `false`    | `-h`    |

## Use cases

The BELLE disassembler can be used to easily and quickly disassemble binaries back into their original source code.

Subroutines, however, are not preserved, as they are an abstraction at assembly level and will only appear in binary as a location that is jumped to.

The BELLE disassembler can be utilized to verify that the assembler has worked properly, and prove that it is possible to extract the original assembly back out of the binary.
