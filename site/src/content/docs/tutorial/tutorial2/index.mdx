Let's dive right in and start off with the ***very*** original, and super unique, "Hello, world!" program.

#### What's going on here though?

Now that you've seen a little bit of assembly, let's break down the individual parts of this program.

##### Breaking it down

First, let's start with line 1:

```asm
lea r0, @hello_start
```

We can dissect this line into 3 parts.

The first word here is the ***operation***.

```asm
lea
```
The left hand side (LHS) is the **first operand**.

```asm
r0
```

And lastly, the right hand side is the **second operand**.

```asm
@hello_start
```

#### But what does this mean?

Every machine is capable of executing **instructions**. These instructions manipulate the different components of the machine in simple and basic ways.


Each instruction is composed of the operation and operands, with the operation specifying **what to do** and the operands specifying **what to do it with**.


This instruction in particular is known as the **Load Effective Address** instruction.


When the CPU encounters this, what actually happens is a **memory address** (not the value at an address) is loaded into a register.


In this case, the memory address of a label - we will talk about what labels are later - is loaded into register 0.

##### What about the next line?

```asm
lea r1, @hello_end
```

Similar to the first line, this performs a Load Effective Address instruction to load the memory address of `hello_end` into register 1.

#### Labels

A label is a symbolic location that is defined with `label_name:` (e.g. `fish:`)

At compile/assemble time, labels are resolved to real memory addresses, and when an instruction references the address of a label (such as with `@label_name`), it is replaced with the address of the label.

Here, we are defining `hello_start` and `hello_end`, and the ASCII string in between them essentially says "Put a string in memory here".

`hello_start` references the first character of the string, and `hello_end` references the end of the string block.


##### But what are `.asciiz` and `.word`?

`.asciiz` and `.word` are **assembler directives** that tell the assembler to simply load the memory address(es) where the directive appears with the ASCII values of a string or with a numeric literal.

`.word` will accept a numeric value, whilst `.asciiz` accepts a full string.

###### What is a "word"?

Computer architecture has a concept known as a "word", and "word"s are fixed size units of data for processing.

In BELLE, and other architecures, words are 16 bits in length. Thus, when you declare a `.word`, it simply assigns 16 bits of memory with the given data inside of it.

#### The next line

```asm
int 8
```

In many languages, `int` is used to declare integers. However, in many assembly languages, `int` actually means *interrupt*.

##### What are interrupts?

An *interrupt* in assembly essentially "pauses" the program (or "interrupts" it), to perform some task, and then return to the program execution.

Many CPU architectures and instruction sets have regions of memory that contain code to be executed upon an interrupt call.

For BELLE, the interrupts are not implemented as blocks of code on the machine's memory, and instead are part of the software.

###### What is the '8'?

Each interrupt call is assigned a given interrupt *code*. In many other ISAs, the interrupt code is held in some register when the interrupt is called.

But, in the BELLE-ISA, interrupts are generated with their respective code in the instruction to avoid having to read a register.

In this case, interrupt *8* is the code to "Print all values from the memory address in `r0` to the memory address in `r1` as ASCII characters.

#### Concluding

Lastly, the program has a

```asm
hlt
```

To tell the CPU to stop execution.

So, there you have it! Your very first "Hello, world!" program for the Big Endian, Low Level Emulator. Try to change some text or some instructions and see what happens. The interactive box is ***fully*** interactive, so all parts of the assembler and emulator work just fine in every instance that you'll see it.

Now, let's have a look at **moving data** on the next tutorial.
