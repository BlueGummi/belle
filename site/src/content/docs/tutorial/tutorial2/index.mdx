Let's dive right in and start off with the ***very*** original, and super unique, "Hello, world!" program.

#### What's going on here though?

Now that you've seen a little bit of assembly, let's break down the individual parts of this program.

##### Breaking it down

First, let's start with line 1:

```asm
   lea r0, @hello_start
```

We can dissect this line into 3 parts.

The first word here is the ***operation***.

```asm
   lea
```
The left hand side (LHS) is the **first operand**.

```asm
   r0
```

And lastly, the right hand side is the **second operand**.

```asm
   @hello_start
```

##### But what does this mean?

Every machine is capable of executing **instructions**. These instructions manipulate the different components of the machine in simple and basic ways.

Each instruction is composed of the operation and operands, with the operation specifying **what to do** and the operands specifying **what to do it with**.

This instruction in particular is known as the **Load Effective Address** instruction.

When the CPU encounters this, what actually happens is a **memory address** (not the value at an address) is loaded into a register.

In this case, the memory address of a label - we will talk about what labels are later - is loaded into register 0.
